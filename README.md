# Birds Bones and Living Habits

This project is an analysis of the Birds Bones and Living Habits dataset, which can be found here. The dataset contains information about the bones of different bird species, as well as their living habits.
Project Description

The objective of this project is to create a machine learning model that can predict the living habits of birds based on their bone measurements. To achieve this objective, three different machine learning models were trained: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

The project consists of the following Jupyter Notebooks:

    EDA: This notebook contains the exploratory data analysis of the dataset, including data visualization and data cleaning.
    Preprocessing: This notebook contains the preprocessing steps taken to prepare the data for the machine learning models.
    Training: This notebook contains the training of the three different machine learning models.
    Hyperparameter Tuning: This notebook contains the hyperparameter tuning of the three different machine learning models.
    Conclusion: This notebook contains the evaluation of the three different machine learning models, including ROC curves and other metrics, to decide which model performed the best.

## Installation

To run the notebooks in this project, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook installed. 

In addition, you will need to install the following Python packages:

    numpy
    pandas
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    scikit-learn
    tensorflow
    imblearn

These are some important packages used, but some basic packages are also used which can be found in the notebook.

## Usage

To use this project, simply clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebooks in the following order:

    1 - EDA.ipynb
    2 - PreProcessing.ipynb
    3 - Training.ipynb
    4 - HyperparameterTuning.ipynb
    5 - Conclusion.ipynb

The notebooks are designed to be run in sequence, as each notebook builds on the work done in the previous notebooks.

In addition to these notebooks, a combined notebook is also provided.
